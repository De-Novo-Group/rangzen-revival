    <h1>Murmur FAQ</h1>

    <h2>General</h2>

    <h3>What is Murmur?</h3>
    <p>Murmur is a delay-tolerant mesh messaging app. It lets people share short messages without internet access. Messages spread person-to-person via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when devices come near each other.</p>

    <h3>Is it anonymous?</h3>
    <p><strong>YES.</strong> You can use any name (pseudonym) or none at all. The app does not link messages to your phone number, email, or device hardware ID. Your "identity" is a cryptographic key generated on your phone.</p>

    <h3>Does it use the internet?</h3>
    <p><strong>No.</strong> Messaging works entirely offline using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct.</p>
    <p><em>Note: If you enable "QA Mode" (for developers), it will use the internet for telemetry. Do NOT enable QA Mode in restricted environments.</em></p>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <h3>What is the "Import Contacts" feature?</h3>
    <p>This helps you find friends who also use Murmur.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> It does <strong>not</strong> upload your contacts.</li>
        <li><strong>How it works:</strong> It takes phone numbers from your address book, "hashes" them (scrambles them into code), and compares them with hashes from other Murmur users you meet. If they match, you become friends automatically.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What does the "Heart" (Like) button do?</h3>
    <p>Currently, this is a <strong>local bookmark</strong>. Tapping the heart marks the message as important <em>to you</em> and saves it.</p>
    <p><em>Note: Unlike social media, this "like" is <strong>not</strong> broadcast to the network. Other users do not see how many likes a message has. This may change in future versions.</em></p>

    <h3>What is the "Trust" indicator?</h3>
    <p>The colored bar on the left of a message shows its trust level:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong style="color: #4caf50;">Green:</strong> Highly trusted (from a Friend or Friend-of-Friend).</li>
        <li><strong style="color: #ffeb3b;">Yellow:</strong> Neutral.</li>
        <li><strong style="color: #f44336;">Red:</strong> Low trust (unknown source or spam).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How many messages are exchanged?</h3>
    <p>By default, up to <strong>50 messages</strong> are swapped every time you meet someone. This happens quickly (usually under 30 seconds).</p>

    <h2>Technical</h2>

    <h3>How does it work offline?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bluetooth (BLE):</strong> Used to discover nearby users and exchange small amounts of data (low power).</li>
        <li><strong>Wi-Fi Direct:</strong> Used to move larger amounts of data quickly (~50-100 meters range).</li>
        <li><strong>LAN/Hotspot:</strong> If you are on the same Wi-Fi router (e.g., a coffee shop or a mobile hotspot), Murmur will find peers over the local network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why do I see a "Location" icon?</h3>
    <p>Android requires <strong>Location Permission</strong> to scan for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices. Murmur does <strong>not</strong> track your GPS location or put it on a map. We only use this permission to find nearby peers.</p>

    <h3>Why do I see "Invitation to connect"?</h3>
    <p>When moving large amounts of data, Murmur may try to connect via Wi-Fi Direct. Android requires you to approve this connection for security reasons. If you recognize the peer (or just want to receive messages), click <strong>Accept</strong>.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <h3>Can the government see my messages?</h3>
    <p><strong>Not remotely.</strong> There is no central server to hack or subpoena. Messages move directly from phone to phone.</p>
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> If someone physically takes your unlocked phone, they can see your messages. Use a strong screen lock.
    </div>

    <h3>Can I delete a message?</h3>
    <p>You can delete it from your phone, but you <strong>cannot</strong> recall it from the network. Once a message spreads to someone else, it is out of your control. This prevents censorship.</p>

    <h3>Is the app secure?</h3>
    <p>The app is signed with a developer key to prevent tampering. Messages are digitally signed to prove they came from the same author (pseudonym), but they are currently <strong>public</strong> (unencrypted) to the mesh network, similar to a public Twitter feed.</p>
